# You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.
# The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.
# For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
# Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
# Explanation:
# The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
# Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
# We return the new list after removing this node.

# Example2:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,2,4]

# Example 3:
# Input: head = [2,1]
# Output: [2]
# Explanation:
# The above figure represents the given linked list.
# For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
# Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.

## The Solution ##

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        if not head.next: return head.next
        length: int = 0
        curr: Optional[ListNode] = head
        while curr:
            length += 1
            curr = curr.next
        length = length // 2
        pre: Optional[ListNode]; curr: Optional[ListNode]
        pre, curr = head, head.next
        while length > 1:
            pre, curr = curr, curr.next
            length -= 1
        pre.next = curr.next
        return head
